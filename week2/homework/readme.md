This program is a US Customary System to Metric System converter, in particular inches, feet, yards, and miles to centimeters, meters, and kilometers.

There will be a text-box for the number, a drop-down menu to choose the US Customary unit, a drop-down menu to choose the Metric System unit you want to convert to, and a submit button.
