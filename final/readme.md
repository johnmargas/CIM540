#### Character Information

###### this might be the smallest header
I need to create an array of characters, which I'll call 'characterArray'. In characterArray I want to have the names of the characters, the scene the character first appears in, their appearance description (if there is any), how many total scenes they're in, and how many total lines of dialogue they have. First thing I have to do is grab all the characters.
