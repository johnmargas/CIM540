DEV is having sex with RACHEL.
DEV
Fuck fuck.
RACHEL
What? What happened?
DEV.
The condom broke.
RACHEL
Oh. Okay, do you have another one? Just
go put it on, hurry.
DEV
Well, I’m just worried because it broke
and I was kinda all up in there.
RACHEL
How long were you all up in there with it
broken?
DEV
I don’t know, I just noticed it now. Are
you on birth control stuff?
RACHEL
No, but you didn’t finish, so it’s fine.
DEV
But aren’t there some little guys in the
pre-cum? Should we maybe get a morning
after pill to be safe?
RACHEL
No no, it’s fine. You can’t pregnant from
pre-cum.
DEV
I actually had a friend who was in a
situation like this and they got
pregnant, so...
RACHEL
That seems anecdotal.

No, no, I knew the person, it’s a real

RACHEL
That’s what anecdotal means.
DEV
Oh I thought anecdotal was like a fancy
way of saying urban legend.
RACHEL
No, it means you take one example and
apply it to everything.
DEV
Got it, okay. Well, neither of us are
doctors. Isn’t it worth a minute to
Google it just to be safe?
RACHEL
Yeah, okay. Let’s look it up.
They are on their phones.
RACHEL (CONT’D)
Okay, here, pre-cum does not contain
sperm.
DEV
I got the Mayo Clinic here, it says if
you’ve ejaculated recently, there could
be sperms hanging out in there and the
pre-cum might grab ’em on the way.
RACHEL
Okay, well, when’s the last time you
ejaculated?
DEV
Uh... this is kind of embarrassing, but
earlier today.
RACHEL
With another person?
DEV
No, I masturbated, I jerked off.
RACHEL

I get it. I get it. Well sperm can live
outside the body for 7 days, the motility
goes down after 72 hours, and you
ejaculated, what? 4 hours ago? Dammit,

The PHARMACIST grabs a box of Plan B and sets it down.

Great thanks. Is this a good brand?
PHARMACIST
It’s the best and only brand.
DEV
Great. You want anything else? Snacks?

There it is, huh? Why is it packaged like
headphones? So hard to open.
RACHEL
Yeah, I’ll open it up at home.
DEV
What I usually do with this type of
thing, is I take some scissors and go up

rip it open.

ARNOLD
I don’t know why they call it Plan B.
What is Plan A? Having the kid? That’s a
terrible plan.
DEV
I think Plan A is you don’t release a
million of your sperm into someone you
don’t know that well.
(to Arnold)
You ever had a condom break?
ARNOLD
No, but in general, I try not to wear
’em. They feel weird on my guy. I usually
just pull out. Plus my count is pretty
low.
DEV
Really?
ARNOLD
I spent a lot of time in hot tubs, so I
think that may have melted some of my
boys.
DEV
Denise, I need to become a lesbian, you
guys don’t worry about any of this shit,
right?
DENISE
Nope. Don’t worry about getting pregnant,
we’re less likely to get STDs, I’m not
putting copper things up in my vagina or
nothing. It’s the best.
DEV
Well whatever you do, it’s not 100% safe.

DENISE
No doubt.
DEV
But then, think about this, I want to go
get some pasta later, if I had a kid, I
couldn’t go, I’d have to call a sitter or
some shit. I probably wouldn’t get to eat
pasta, that sounds horrible.
ARNOLD
That said, I do feel like I know parents
that still eat pasta.

You know what the move is though? You get

you’re getting all the hugs and kisses.
DEV
Denise, women’s bodies just tell you when
you are ready for kids, right? So at some

“Denise! Kids!”

Dev looks at the line. The first woman, LINE LADY 1, is a
punk rock type girl with a lot of tattoos. The second woman,
LINE LADY 2, is a little bit older and looks more like a
possible mom. Dev asks the second woman.
DEV (CONT’D)
(to Line Lady 2)
Excuse me, madam, could you accompany
this young girl I’m babysitting into the
bathroom?
LINE LADY 1
Why didn’t you ask me? Am I not enough of
a madam?
DEV
I don’t know... she seems like she might
be more of a mom?
LINE LADY 2
Oh, so you think I’m old? I’m just an old
lady to you?
DEV
No, I just-LILA
I need to gooooooo noooooow!
DEV
Fine! I’ll go with her.

line ladies)
You guys got eyes on Grant, right?
The ladies glare at him.

Alright, kids. We’re almost home!

Dev gets a text from Amanda: “Really sorry -- can you pick up
some beer at the grocery store? Meeting running late, really
appreciate it!”
DEV (CONT’D)
Ah shit. Okay, we gotta go to the grocery
store and pick up some beer for your mom.
GRANT
You said shit!
DEV
Yeah Grant, ’cause I’m 31 and I make my

You’re 8 and you have to do what I say -and we’re going to the store.

Yeah, he’s my friend’s kid. Everything
okay?
CLERK
Sir, he’s taking his penis and rubbing it
on all the packages of frozen waffles.
DEV
What?! When?
CLERK
Just now.
DEV
How did -- Grant, you can’t do that!
GRANT
It’s cold, and when I put my wiener on
it, it feels good!
CLERK
I’m going to need you to pay for those
waffles, sir.
DEV
Ugh. How many packages?
CLERK
Well, I’d say all 30 that are in the
front of this display.

Jesus, he was gone for like one minute!
No way he touched all those boxes.

Man, I was watching those guys for like

kid for a year and you seem to be doing
great. What’s your secret?
KYLE
My secret is I’m getting divorced.
DEV
Hahaha!

Wait, what? You’re serious?

KYLE
We’ve just been dealing with a lot of
issues. We tried to figure things out,
but I don’t think it’s going to work.
DEV
Oh. Oh god. I thought everything was
going really well. What about all the
fulfillment and higher sense of purpose?
KYLE
Ugh, that’s just bullshit you tell people
at parties. What am I supposed to say? I
don’t sleep, I haven’t fucked in a year,
I never see my friends, I hate my wife?
DEV
Damn. Yeah, I guess you can’t say all
that. Pretty depressing. I mean, sorry. I
know that’s your life, I just mean...
it’s not really good party... what’s the
word I’m thinking of...

It’s tough. We’d only been dating six

really felt like we could pull it off. It
started off okay, but then it got a
little rocky. It was just too soon. Then

He and Dev’s daughter continue to sling around and spread
flour everywhere.

bag of sandwiches.

Hey man!
NATHAN
Hey dude. I’ve got sandwiches! Who’s

I am! I’ll go grab some beer.
Amanda walks off to the kitchen. Nathan and Dev sit on the
couch.
NATHAN
You okay, bud?
DEV
Oof. I just watched Grant and Lila for
like an hour and it was so intense.
They’re always yelling and causing a
ruckus. Their voices are so shrill. We
passed Lila’s school in the cab and she
just goes “That’s my school!” over and
over for like five minutes. Even at a
normal volume, very useless information
to share.

That’s rough.

Grant and Lila walk in with a plate with a weird-looking

It’s my first sandwich ever and I want

thanks guys.
Dev looks at the two sandwiches: the delicious, beautiful,
professionally made sub from the best place in New York City,
and the disgusting, torn-in-half, weird-looking sandwich made
by two poorly-behaved but adorable kids.
He takes a long beat.
